    "## Worksheet Title\n",
    "\n",
    "All worksheets should start with a title formatted as a level 1 heading:\n",
    "\n",
    "```md\n",
    "# Worksheet ?: All Worksheets Should Have a Clear Title\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Worksheet titles should be followed with a short description of the worksheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "This followed by a list of 3 to 4 learning aims for the worksheet.  We use the HTML `div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\"` to colour this is a nice way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```md\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "<b>By the end of this worksheet you should be able to:</b><br> \n",
    "- Identify and list the names of PRECIS output data in PP format using standard Linux commands.<br>\n",
    "- Use basic Iris commands to load data files, and view Iris cubes. <br>\n",
    "- Use Iris commands to remove the model rim, select data variables and save the output as NetCDF files.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When rendered, it looks like this:\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "<b>By the end of this worksheet you should be able to:</b><br> \n",
    "- Identify and list the names of PRECIS output data in PP format using standard Linux commands.<br>\n",
    "- Use basic Iris commands to load data files, and view Iris cubes. <br>\n",
    "- Use Iris commands to remove the model rim, select data variables and save the output as NetCDF files.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to start each learning aim with a verb.  Keep them short and to the point.  If you have more than 3 to 4 learning aims, consider whether there is too much content in the workbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wish to use a Note box to draw the learners attention to particular actions or points to note.  Note boxes are created using `div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "```md\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> In the boxes where there is code or where you are asked to type code, click in the box, then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> to run the code. <br>\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> An percentage sign <code>%</code> is needed to run some commands on the shell. It is noted where this is needed.<br>\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> A hash <code>#</code> denotes a comment; anything written after this character does not affect the command being run. <br>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which looks like:\n",

    "## Contents\n",
    "### [1.1: Data locations and file names](#1.1) \n",
    "### ...additional headings\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Items in the contents list are formatted  as level 3 headings.  Note the `[Link Name](Link location)` syntax. Each subsequent heading in the notebook needs to have a `id` tag associated with it for the links to work.  These are formatted like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```md\n",
    "<a id='1.1'></a>\n",
    "## 1.1 Data locations and file names\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the `id` string must match the link location otherwise the link won't work.  Remember to update both the link title numbering and the link id numbering if you are reordering content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section Headings\n",
    "\n",
    "To help users navigate round the document use section headings to break the content into sections. As detailed above, each section heading needs to have an `id` tag associated with it to build the Contents links.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to further subdivide each section, use bold letters with a parentheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "```md\n",
    "**a)** Ordinary section text continues...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "Use links to point learners to additional learning resources. These follow the standard markdown style: `[Link text](Link location)`, eg.\n",

    "```md\n",
    "**`cd`**\n",
